# C# Hooks

> This file extends [common/hooks.md](../common/hooks.md) with C#-specific content.

## PostToolUse Hooks

Configure in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **dotnet format**: Auto-format edited C# files and apply analyzer fixes
- **dotnet build**: Verify the solution or project still compiles after edits
- **dotnet test --no-build**: Re-run the nearest relevant test project after behavior changes

## Stop Hooks

- Run a final `dotnet build` before ending a session with broad C# changes
- Warn on modified `appsettings*.json` files so secrets do not get committed
